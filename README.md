# Personal-info-discord-bot
A discord bot that scans PDF resumes for personal information and automatically deletes resumes that contain some. It will then send an informative message to the user who sent the file with instructions on how to properly remove personal information and reupload. This bot was built for the Rumie Initiative which is a non-profit organization founded to educate children in underserved communities around the world.
